I'm trying to revive the long-abandoned Keybinder addon coded by Kraftman. My focus, because of limited programming skills, is mostly on visualization.

KeyUI shows your keyboard, and what each button on your key is bound to.

How to use:

- Type /kui or /keyui to access the virtual keyboard.
- Hover over the keys to see what they are bound to.
- Click on the keys to unbind them or to set them to a different spell/macro.
- Click on the modifiers (shift/ctrl/alt) to toggle them on and off, to change the keyboard to show modified keybinds.
