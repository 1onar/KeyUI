I'm trying to revive the long-abandoned Keybinder addon coded by Kraftman. My focus, because of limited programming skills, is mostly on visualization.

KeyUI shows your keyboard, and what each button on your key is bound to.

The Idea:
May you want to rethink your binds, reorganize or try a new Specc and get an overview. May you log into a long forgotten twink, start a new character, or start playing WoW again. KeyUI helps visualize your keybinds.


How to use:
- Type /kui or /keyui to access the virtual keyboard or click the MinimapButton.
- Choose between "QWERTZ", "QWERTY", "AZERTY" and "Razer Tartarus", "Razer Tartarus 2"
- Hover over the keys to see what they are bound to.
- Click on the keys to unbind them or to set them to a different spell/macro.
- Click on the modifiers (SHIFT / CTRL / ALT) to toggle them on and off, to change the keyboard to show modified keybinds.
- Click on "Hide" to close the menu.
- Click on "Refresh" to register new bindings.
- ESC to close.

Whats next?
- Add a Mouse Layout
- Add Moving Keys (W, A, S, D) as Icons
- Add Bonus Bars (Stealth, Druid, ...)
- Add Pet Bindings
- Get rid of the "refresh"-button and automatically refresh

 

Known Issues:
- Sometimes a LUA Error when opening WoW Editor Mode (to be honest something is broken with the Editor Mode. The addon doesnt ask for targets..)


I would like to thank my guild master "L.M.". Without him, reviving this addon/code would not have been possible.
